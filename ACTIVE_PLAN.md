**Last Updated**: 2025-01-22
**Status**: ACTIVE

## Current Sprint (January 22-29, 2025)

### ðŸŽ¯ Sprint Goal
Complete NLP analysis pipeline and begin report generation system implementation.

### ðŸ“‹ Tasks

#### In Progress
- [ ] **NLP Analysis Pipeline** (Priority: HIGH)
  - [ ] Design analysis architecture
  - [ ] Implement text summarization
  - [ ] Add keyword extraction
  - [ ] Create trend detection algorithms
  - [ ] Build entity recognition system
  - [ ] Integrate with storage layer

#### Upcoming This Sprint
- [ ] **Report Generation Foundation** (Priority: HIGH)
  - [ ] Design report template system
  - [ ] Create base report generator class
  - [ ] Implement markdown report output
  - [ ] Add basic data aggregation

#### Backlog for Sprint
- [ ] **Testing & Documentation**
  - [ ] Write tests for NLP components
  - [ ] Document API endpoints
  - [ ] Create user guide for report generation

## Recently Completed (January 22, 2025)

âœ… **Automated Scheduling System**
- Implemented CronScheduler engine
- Created preset configurations
- Added CLI and Web API integration
- Set up systemd service
- Documented scheduler usage

âœ… **Web Dashboard**
- Built FastAPI application
- Created responsive HTML interface
- Implemented search functionality
- Added real-time statistics

âœ… **SEC EDGAR Collector**
- Integrated SEC filing collection
- Added company-specific searches
- Implemented filing importance scoring

## Next Sprint Preview (January 29 - February 5, 2025)

### Planned Focus Areas
1. **Complete Report Generation System**
   - Industry-specific report templates
   - Automated insights generation
   - Export formats (PDF, HTML, JSON)

2. **Enhanced Analysis Features**
   - Sentiment analysis
   - Topic modeling
   - Cross-source correlation

3. **System Optimization**
   - Performance tuning
   - Caching layer implementation
   - Query optimization

## Key Decisions & Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **NLP Framework**: Start with spaCy for entity recognition, NLTK for basic processing
- **Summarization**: Use extractive summarization initially, consider abstractive later
- **Report Storage**: Store generated reports in filesystem with metadata in DB

### Technical Debt to Address
- Add comprehensive error handling in collectors
- Implement connection pooling for database
- Add rate limiting middleware for API
- Create data retention policies

### Dependencies & Blockers
- None currently identified

## Success Metrics for Current Sprint

- [ ] NLP pipeline processing 100+ documents successfully
- [ ] At least 3 analysis types implemented (summarization, keywords, entities)
- [ ] Basic report generation working end-to-end
- [ ] Test coverage > 70% for new components

## Communication & Updates

- **Daily Progress**: Update task status in this file
- **Weekly Review**: Every Monday, assess sprint progress
- **Blockers**: Document immediately when encountered
- **Completion**: Mark tasks with âœ… and timestamp

## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Continue with NLP implementation
cd /home/cordlesssteve/projects/KnowHunt
python3 -m knowhunt.analysis.nlp

# Test current progress
python3 test_pipeline.py

# Run scheduler
knowhunt scheduler start

# Check system status
knowhunt scheduler status
```

## Notes for Next Session

- Start with NLP pipeline architecture
- Consider using Hugging Face transformers for advanced summarization
- Plan for multilingual support in the future
- Keep analysis modular for easy extension
