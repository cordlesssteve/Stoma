- [ ] Document model-specific quirks and parsing requirements
- [ ] Establish model selection guidelines based on parsing reliability

#### ⚙️ **Model Performance Optimization** (Priority: HIGH)
- [ ] Create model selection matrix based on reliability vs. quality trade-offs
- [ ] Implement intelligent model fallback system (start with best, fallback to reliable)
- [ ] Add model performance tracking (success rate, response time, quality scores)
- [ ] Configure automatic model selection based on content type and success history
- [ ] Establish production model recommendations with parsing validation

#### 📊 **Production Integration** (Priority: HIGH)
- [ ] Integrate simplified parser into main pipeline system
- [ ] Enable model quality comparison workflows in production
- [ ] Implement automated model validation testing
- [ ] Create production-ready model selection strategies
- [ ] Deploy enhanced parsing to existing report generation systems
