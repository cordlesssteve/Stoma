# Security Documentation

This directory contains security policies, practices, and guidelines for the Stoma Research Intelligence System.

## Contents

### Planned Documentation

- **API Key Management** - Best practices for managing API keys and secrets
- **Data Privacy** - GDPR/CCPA compliance and data handling policies
- **Authentication & Authorization** - User authentication and access control
- **Rate Limiting** - API rate limiting and abuse prevention
- **Dependency Security** - Managing and auditing third-party dependencies
- **Secrets Management** - Using environment variables and secret vaults
- **Vulnerability Response** - Security incident response procedures

## Security Considerations

### Current Security Measures

1. **Environment Variables**: Sensitive credentials stored in `.env` (gitignored)
2. **API Rate Limiting**: Respectful rate limiting for all external API calls
3. **robots.txt Compliance**: Web scraping respects robots.txt directives
4. **Database Security**: PostgreSQL peer authentication for local development

### Areas for Enhancement

- [ ] Implement API key rotation policies
- [ ] Add input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Set up security scanning in CI/CD
- [ ] Document security audit procedures
- [ ] Create incident response playbook

## Quick Reference

### Secure Configuration Checklist

- ✅ Never commit `.env` files to version control
- ✅ Use `.env.example` as template without actual secrets
- ✅ Rotate API keys periodically
- ✅ Use HTTPS for all external API calls
- ✅ Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- ✅ Keep dependencies up to date
- ✅ Run security audits regularly

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately to the project maintainers rather than creating a public issue.
