# Phase 2: LLM-Enhanced Analysis & Intelligence Strategy

**Target**: February 15, 2025  
**Approach**: LLM-Heavy with Local Model Infrastructure  
**Core Philosophy**: Overnight batch processing for comprehensive analysis

## 🎯 Strategic Approach

### **Option B: LLM-Heavy Architecture** (Selected)

**Why This Approach**:
- Superior contextual understanding vs traditional NLP
- Leverages full PDF content (117k+ chars per paper)
- Cost-effective with local models + overnight processing
- Future-proof with advancing model capabilities

### **Local + Cloud Hybrid Strategy**
```
Daytime: Urgent tasks → Claude (quota-aware)
Overnight: Batch processing → Local models (unlimited)
Emergency: Priority tasks → Best available model
```

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Requirements

### **Local LLM Setup**
- **Primary Model**: Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct (general analysis)
- **Technical Model**: DeepSeek-Coder-V2 (code/methods extraction)  
- **Academic Model**: Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (research writing)
- **Hardware**: RTX 4090+ (24GB VRAM), 64GB+ RAM, 500GB+ SSD

### **Processing Windows**
- **Overnight Window**: 1 AM - 7 AM (intensive local processing)
- **Daytime**: Interactive + urgent tasks (quota-managed cloud)
- **Queue System**: Non-urgent tasks → overnight processing

```

### **2. Research-Specific Analysis**
```python
# Academic intelligence
- Novelty assessment (1-10 score)
- Methodology rigor evaluation
- Reproducibility scoring
- Research gap identification
```

### **3. Cross-Document Intelligence**
```python
# Multi-paper analysis
- Topic cluster detection
- Research trend emergence
- Citation network analysis
- Cross-domain pollination
```

## 🌙 Overnight Processing Architecture

### **Batch Analysis Engine**
- **Target**: Process 50-100 papers per night
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple local models simultaneously
