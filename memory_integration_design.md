# Memory MCP Integration Design for Research Intelligence

## Current State Analysis

### Memory MCP Capabilities (Expected)
- **Knowledge Graph Storage**: Entity-relationship mapping
- **Contextual Memory**: Project-specific knowledge persistence
- **Layered Memory**: Different memory scopes (personal, project, domain)
- **Semantic Relationships**: Understanding connections between concepts

### KnowHunt Current System
- **Research Collection**: ArXiv, Reddit, HackerNews, SEC filings
- **LLM Analysis**: Novel contributions, technical innovations, business implications
- **Report Generation**: PDF reports with structured insights
- **Unanalyzed Tracking**: Failed analysis logging

## Integration Architecture

### 1. Memory-Enhanced Research Context

**Before Analysis**: Query memory for relevant context
```python
# Pseudo-code for memory integration
async def analyze_with_memory_context(papers, query):
    # Query memory for related concepts
    memory_context = await memory_mcp.query_knowledge_graph({
        "concepts": extract_key_concepts(papers),
        "projects": ["KnowHunt", "current_research_focus"],
        "timeframe": "recent_6_months"
    })

    # Enhance analysis with memory context
    enhanced_analysis = await specialized_llm_analyzer.analyze_with_context(
        papers=papers,
        memory_context=memory_context,
        user_interests=memory_context.get("user_focus_areas", [])
    )
```

### 2. Project-Specific Intelligence

**Memory Layers for Research Intelligence**:

```
Personal Layer:
├── Research Interests (AI, quantum computing, biotech)
├── Current Projects (KnowHunt, other tools)
├── Reading History (papers read, insights gained)
└── Learning Gaps (topics to explore)

Project Layer (KnowHunt):
├── Architecture Knowledge (pipeline components, LLM configs)
├── Previous Insights (recurring themes, breakthrough papers)
├── Tool Evolution (feature additions, performance improvements)
└── User Feedback (report quality, missing insights)

Domain Layer (AI Research):
├── Key Researchers (follows, citations)
├── Important Venues (conferences, journals)
├── Trending Topics (emerging themes)
└── Breakthrough Timeline (major advances)
```

### 3. Memory-Enhanced Prompting

**Context-Aware Specialized Prompts**:

```python
def generate_memory_enhanced_prompt(analysis_type, content, memory_context):
    base_prompt = get_specialized_prompt(analysis_type)

    # Add memory context
    if memory_context.get("user_interests"):
        base_prompt += f"\nUser is particularly interested in: {memory_context['user_interests']}"

    if memory_context.get("current_projects"):
        base_prompt += f"\nRelate findings to current projects: {memory_context['current_projects']}"

    if memory_context.get("related_insights"):
        base_prompt += f"\nConsider these related insights: {memory_context['related_insights']}"

    return base_prompt
```

### 4. Continuous Learning Loop

**Memory Updates from Analysis**:

```
Research Paper Analysis
         ↓
Extract Key Insights
         ↓
Update Memory Graph:
├── New Concepts → Add nodes
├── Research Trends → Update relationships
├── Personal Relevance → Weight user interests
└── Project Connections → Link to KnowHunt goals
         ↓
Enhanced Future Analysis
```

## Practical Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Memory MCP Connection
- Test memory MCP availability and capabilities
- Design memory schema for research intelligence
- Implement basic read/write operations

### Phase 2: Context Enhancement
- Integrate memory queries into analysis pipeline
- Enhance specialized prompts with memory context
- Track user interaction patterns

### Phase 3: Intelligent Personalization
- Learn from user feedback on report quality
- Adjust analysis focus based on reading history
- Predict research interests from behavior patterns

### Phase 4: Project Memory Integration
- Store KnowHunt system knowledge in memory
- Enable self-improving pipeline based on performance
- Cross-reference insights across research sessions

## Potential Benefits

### Immediate Value
- **Personalized Reports**: Focus on topics user actually cares about
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Connect new papers to existing knowledge
- **Reduced Noise**: Filter out irrelevant insights based on history

### Long-Term Intelligence
- **Learning Research Assistant**: Understands your research style
- **Trend Detection**: Spots patterns across your research timeline
- **Knowledge Building**: Connects insights to form larger understanding

### System Evolution
- **Self-Improvement**: Pipeline learns from successes/failures
- **Adaptive Prompting**: Prompts evolve based on what produces good insights
- **Intelligent Curation**: Focuses on high-value research areas

## Technical Compatibility

### Memory MCP ↔ Research Intelligence Mapping

| Memory MCP Feature | Research Intelligence Use |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Knowledge Graph | Map research concepts & relationships |
| Entity Storage | Store papers, authors, institutions |
| Relationship Tracking | Connect insights across papers/time |
| Context Windows | Maintain research session continuity |
| Layered Memory | Personal/Project/Domain research focus |
| Semantic Search | Find related papers in history |

### API Integration Points

```python
class MemoryEnhancedReportGenerator:
    async def generate_with_memory(self, papers, query):
        # 1. Query memory for context
        context = await self.memory_client.get_research_context(
            query=query,
            user_profile="research_analyst",
            project="KnowHunt"
        )

        # 2. Run enhanced analysis
        analysis = await self.specialized_analyzer.analyze_with_context(
            papers, context
        )

        # 3. Update memory with insights
        await self.memory_client.store_insights(analysis)

        # 4. Generate personalized report
        return self.pdf_generator.create_personalized_report(
            analysis, context
        )
```

## Conclusion

The memory MCP integration would transform KnowHunt from a **stateless research tool** into a **learning research assistant** that:

1. **Remembers** your research interests and projects
2. **Connects** new findings to your existing knowledge
3. **Learns** from your feedback and behavior patterns
4. **Evolves** its analysis to be more relevant over time

This is entirely compatible with the current architecture and would be a natural evolution once memory MCP becomes available.
