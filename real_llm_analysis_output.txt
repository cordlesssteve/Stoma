    Title: Dynamic LoRA for Efficient Model Fine-Tuning
    
    Abstract: We propose Dynamic LoRA, a method that adaptively selects rank values for Low-Rank Adaptation during fine-tuning. Our approach reduces parameters by 90% while maintaining 98% performance on GLUE benchmarks.
    
    Method: We analyze gradient flow to determine layer importance and assign higher ranks to critical layers. This eliminates manual hyperparameter tuning.
    
    Results: Dynamic LoRA achieves superior performance compared to standard LoRA with fewer parameters.
