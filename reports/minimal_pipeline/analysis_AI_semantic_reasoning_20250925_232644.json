      "title": "SciReasoner: Laying the Scientific Reasoning Ground Across Disciplines",
      "abstract": "We present a scientific reasoning foundation model that aligns natural\nlanguage with heterogeneous scientific representations. The model is pretrained\non a 206B-token corpus spanning scientific text, pure sequences, and\nsequence-text pairs, then aligned via SFT on 40M instructions, annealed\ncold-start bootstrapping to elicit long-form chain-of-thought, and\nreinforcement learning with task-specific reward shaping, which instills\ndeliberate scientific reasoning. It supports four capability families, covering\nup to 103 tasks across workflows: (i) faithful translation between text and\nscientific formats, (ii) text/knowledge extraction, (iii) property prediction,\n(iv) property classification, (v) unconditional and conditional sequence\ngeneration and design. Compared with specialist systems, our approach broadens\ninstruction coverage, improves cross-domain generalization, and enhances\nfidelity. We detail data curation and training and show that cross-discipline\nlearning strengthens transfer and downstream reliability. The model, instruct\ntuning datasets and the evaluation code are open-sourced at\nhttps://huggingface.co/SciReason and\nhttps://github.com/open-sciencelab/SciReason.",

      "abstract": "We present SD3.5-Flash, an efficient few-step distillation framework that\nbrings high-quality image generation to accessible consumer devices. Our\napproach distills computationally prohibitive rectified flow models through a\nreformulated distribution matching objective tailored specifically for few-step\ngeneration. We introduce two key innovations: \"timestep sharing\" to reduce\ngradient noise and \"split-timestep fine-tuning\" to improve prompt alignment.\nCombined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder\nrestructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid\ngeneration and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware\nconfigurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices,\nfrom mobile phones to desktop computers. Through extensive evaluation including\nlarge-scale user studies, we demonstrate that SD3.5-Flash consistently\noutperforms existing few-step methods, making advanced generative AI truly\naccessible for practical deployment.",

      "title": "Interactive Recommendation Agent with Active User Commands",
      "abstract": "Traditional recommender systems rely on passive feedback mechanisms that\nlimit users to simple choices such as like and dislike. However, these\ncoarse-grained signals fail to capture users' nuanced behavior motivations and\nintentions. In turn, current systems cannot also distinguish which specific\nitem attributes drive user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, resulting in\ninaccurate preference modeling. These fundamental limitations create a\npersistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately\nundermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness.\n  To address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation\nFeed (IRF), a pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within\nmainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users\nto passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control\nover recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support\nthis paradigm, we develop RecBot, a dual-agent architecture where a Parser\nAgent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a\nPlanner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly\npolicy adjustment. To enable practical deployment, we employ\nsimulation-augmented knowledge distillation to achieve efficient performance\nwhile maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Through extensive offline and\nlong-term online experiments, RecBot shows significant improvements in both\nuser satisfaction and business outcomes.",
