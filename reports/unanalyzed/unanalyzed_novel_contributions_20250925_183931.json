Our innovative training recipe\n        strategically captures knowledge from larger models via encoder-decoder\n        initialization and geometric embedding distillation. EmbeddingGemma (300M)\n        achieves state-of-the-art results and outperforms prior top models with\n        fewer than 500M parameters.\n        ",
