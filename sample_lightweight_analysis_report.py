        We introduce Dynamic LoRA, a novel approach to parameter-efficient fine-tuning that 
        dynamically adjusts Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) ranks based on layer importance analysis. 
        Our method achieves 98.5% of full fine-tuning performance while reducing parameters by 90%.
        
        Key Innovation: Gradient-based importance scoring determines optimal rank allocation per layer.
        
        Results: GLUE benchmark evaluation shows 5% improvement over standard LoRA with 30% fewer parameters.
        
        Applications: Enables efficient model adaptation for mobile deployment and edge computing scenarios.
