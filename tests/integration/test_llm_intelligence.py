        "content": """
        Abstract: We propose SeqR, a novel approach for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) using sequence-to-sequence learning. Unlike traditional fine-tuning methods that update all model parameters, SeqR introduces a lightweight adapter architecture that learns to generate sequences of low-rank adaptations (LoRA) dynamically based on input context. Our method achieves comparable performance to full fine-tuning while using only 0.1% of the trainable parameters.

        Introduction: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various NLP tasks. However, fine-tuning these models for specific tasks requires significant computational resources due to their massive parameter count. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA have emerged as promising alternatives, but they still require manual configuration and lack adaptivity to different input contexts.

        Method: SeqR operates by training a small sequence-to-sequence model that generates LoRA adapter parameters based on the input sequence. The generated parameters are then applied to the frozen LLM backbone. This approach allows for dynamic adaptation to different types of inputs without requiring separate adapters for each task.

        Experiments: We evaluate SeqR on multiple benchmarks including GLUE, SuperGLUE, and domain-specific tasks. Results show that SeqR matches the performance of traditional LoRA while requiring 10x fewer parameters and providing better generalization to unseen tasks.

        Conclusion: SeqR represents a significant advancement in parameter-efficient fine-tuning, enabling more flexible and efficient adaptation of large language models to downstream tasks.

        "content": """
        Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) is a fundamental computer vision task that involves identifying and tracking objects across video frames. Recent advances in transformer architectures have shown promising results for VOS. This paper presents a comprehensive study of transformer-based approaches for video object segmentation, introducing several novel architectural improvements and training strategies.

        Introduction: Traditional VOS methods rely on convolutional neural networks and recurrent architectures. However, transformers have revolutionized many computer vision tasks due to their ability to model long-range dependencies and global context. We investigate how different transformer designs impact VOS performance.

        Methodology: We propose three key innovations: (1) Temporal attention mechanisms that effectively capture motion patterns, (2) Multi-scale feature fusion using hierarchical transformers, and (3) Memory-efficient training procedures that enable processing of long video sequences.

        Results: Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on DAVIS 2017 and YouTube-VOS datasets, with significant improvements in accuracy and temporal consistency. We demonstrate that our method generalizes well to unseen object categories and video domains.

        Contributions: This work advances the field of video understanding by showing how transformer architectures can be effectively adapted for dense prediction tasks in video data.
